# Stock Details API
This is the back end of a personal project I created to monitor a passion of mine, the stock market.
I used AlphaVantage's free API (https://www.alphavantage.co/) in order to get up to the minute information on stocks.

# Set up
In order to use this you will need to get an API key from https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key and place that key in the `constants.go` file. There is an example which can be found in `internal/constants` with the `constants.go` file
# Project Status
This project is still currently being built as I have found little time to workon it between my real job and the startup I am currently trying to launch with a friend.
